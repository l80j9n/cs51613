The Strategic Direction of Matalan
Assignment   Brief
Students are asked to   develop a strategy   for   Matalan for   the   next   3-5   years.The    individual    report      should    consist    of    the    following      7      sections.      For      each      section      I    will      provide   suggestions on what students could   cover but these   are not restrictive. I will outline all the frameworks   and tools you have in your disposal but that does not mean that you   have to use   all   of them.   However,   failure to   use any of the recommended frameworks   under each section will   result in   no   marks for that   section.   What   you   need   to   have   in   mind   is   that   each   section   has   a   goal   that   you   need   to   meet.   For   each   section   thereof   you   need   to   draw   some   “conclusions”,   take   them   with   you   and   complete   the   next sections. These “conclusions”   need to   be critically justified. Therefore, ensure that you   critically justify   your findings/arguments   in each section.The    term      critically    justify       implies    that      you       need    to       demonstrate       coherent      understanding      and   application   of any theories   or frameworks   used   and that the   ideas/arguments/discussions   presented   in   your   report   are   supported   by   relevant   high   quality   academic   sources.   Industry/firm   reports   and   documents,   news   articles   etc   can   be   used,   but   these   should   be   appropriately   evidenced/   cited   and   supported   by   high quality academic sources.
Your final strategy needs to be informed by all the previous sections. So, the strategy that the company   should   implement   needs to   be justifiable   by all   the   previous analysis.
(1)      Introduction
Introduce the   company,   its   products, the   market   it operates, define your   industry,   define your   target   market.
Briefly assess whether the company   is doing   well   or   bad   at   the   moment.
(2)      Internal Analysis
The   Goal   of   the   Internal   analysis   is   to   identify   your   company’s;   (1)   Capabilities/Strengths   and   value   adding activities   (2) Weaknesses   (3)   Internal Competitive advantage.To achieve this goal, you can use all or a combination of the following frameworks/suggestions (marks   are not allocated based on how many models/frameworks you have used rather if   you have used them   correctly   and   if   you   have   achieved   the   goal   of   the   internal   analysis):
-                Value   Chain
o   Identify your company’s   primary and supplementary activities
o   How these activities add value to your   company
o   Incorporation   of these   activities/resources   in the   Resources    Capabilities table   and   any weaknesses   in the Weaknesses table
-                Resources    Capabilities table
o   Identify   your   company’s   resources   and   briefly   discuss the   corresponding   capabilities   (you can   use a table   if you   wish)
-             Test   the   Distinctive   Capabilities   through   VRIO   model   to   identify   your   company’s   competitive   advantage
o   Briefly discuss the conclusions from VRIO – What   is your   competitive   advantage   and why you   believe so?
-                Weaknesses table
o   Identify your company’s weaknesses and   provide a short term and   long-term solution   (you can   use a table   if you   wish)
(3)      External AnalysisThe   Goal   of the   External   analysis   is to   identify   how the   industry   and the   country/countries   your   firm   operates can affect the   development of   its   strategy. The   Goals   of the   External   analyses   are   (1)   Assess   the   attractiveness   of the   industry you   operate   (2)   perform   a   Competitors’   analysis   (3)   identify   Macro   – environmental factors affecting your   industry and consequently   your   firmTo achieve this goal, you can use all or a combination of the following frameworks/suggestions (marks   are not allocated based on how many models/frameworks you have used rather if   you have used them   correctly and if   you have achieved the goal of   the   external   analysis):
-                The external analysis   is conducted at   an   industry   level –   Define your   industry   –   Be   specific
-                Five forces to   identify the attractiveness   of the   industry   you   operate
o   Identify the forces   (low-medium-high)
o   Discussion on the attractiveness of the   industry   (is   it attractive yes/no   why?)
o   What does this   mean for your company?   (opportunities and threats)
-                Identify your company’s strategic   position AND   your   competitors’   strategic   position
o   Porter’s 3 generic   strategies   OR
o   Bowman’s clock
o   Position your firm and the competitors,   justify why you think they follow this strategic   position, discuss   if this   positioning   is an opportunity or threat for your   company
-                Competitors’   Benchmarking to   identify the Competitors strengths and weaknesses
o   Critical   evaluation   of your   findings   –   are   there   any   opportunities   or   threats   for   your   firm?
-                  PESTEL
o   You    can    use    a    table    to    identify      as      many      RELEVANT      macro-environmental    trends   currently   taking   place   in   the   country/countries   your   firm   operates,   that   can   affect   your   industry and consequently, your firm
o   Select   any   3   KEY   trends   to   discuss   further   –   discuss   their   impact   to   your   industry,   to   your firm and your future strategic   planning   (opportunities/threats?)
(4)      SWOT analysis
In   this   module   SWOT   analysis   is   used   as   a   summary   tool   –   meaning   that   you   use   it   to   summarise   existing   information.
Strengths  Weaknesses   : Should come from your   internal analysis   ONLY.   Opportunities  Threats   : Should come from your external analysis   ONLY.
SWOT should   NOT include any   new information – you need to   populate the SWOT table   using   existing   information from your   previous analysis.
You don’t   have to explain the SWOT analysis   in   a   separate   paragraph   the   table   should   suffice.
(5)    TOWS   matrix
In   the   TOWS   matrix   you   are   going to   combine   the   data   you   gathered   from   the   Internal   and   External   analyses, and you will come   up with tactics/ideas.   It   is the   brainstorming stage.
The way you are going to combine the   data   is   as   follows:Strengths      Opportunities:   What   strengths   do   you   need   to    utilise   to    pursue    one   or    more   of   the   opportunities    which    you    have    identified?    Combine      this      information      to      come      with      one      or      more   tactics/ideas
Strengths    Threats:   What   strengths   do   you   need to   utilise   to   overcome   one   or   more   of the   threats   you   identified? Combine this   information to come with one   or   more tactics/ideas
Opportunities      Weaknesses   :   What   weaknesses   will   you   address   by   pursuing   one   or   more   of   the   opportunities you   identified?   Combine this   information to come with one or   more tactics/ideas
Threats        Weaknesses   :    Come    up    with      ideas      help    you      address      some    of      your      weaknesses      while   overcoming   some   of   your   threats   at   the   sametime.All these   tactics/ideas can be included inside   the   TOWS matrix. One/two sentences   for each idea/tactic   clearly   showing   which   opportunities   +   strengths   etc   you   combined.   You   do   not   have   to   explain   the   TOWS   matrix   in a separate   paragraph, the table should suffice.
(6)    ANSOFF   matrix
In the   ANSOFF   matrix you   need to   position   your tactics/ideas   from   the   TOWS   matrix   inside   the   right   strategy   i.e.   Market   penetration,   market development,   product development, diversification.
From the four strategies and corresponding tactics identified earlier; you need to select two to analyse   further. Whichever two you choose to discuss   is   up to   you.   One   (critically   explicit)   paragrap代 写ULMS 353 The Strategic Direction of MatalanHaskell
代做程序编程语言h   for   eachstrategy   (and   corresponding   tactic)   needs   to   be   included.   These   two   paragraphs   are   crucial   as   they   serve   as   the   “selling   point”   for   the   report.   These   paragraphs   can   discuss   the   following   but   are   not   limited to:
•             Does    this    strategy    and      corresponding    tactic      address      any      opportunities      and/or      overcome   threats?    How    will    the      industry      forces/      Competition/      Macro-factors      affect    your      strategic   option?
•             By    following    this   strategy   and   corresponding   tactic   do   you   capitalise   on   your   competitive   advantage? Yes?   No?   How?   If you   have   not   identified a competitive advantage   in the   internal   analysis, does this strategy and corresponding tactic   help   you   build   one?
•                Implementation plan: how are you going to implement this strategy and corresponding tactic?   Have   you   implemented   this   strategy   before   (as   a   company)?   Yes/no?   was   it   successful?   Is   there a   reason why you   have   not   implemented   it   before?
▫                Market    penetration    -   explain    how   you   will   retain   and   increase   your   market   share.   Ideas:   how   will   you   deal   with   the   competitors,   what   kinds   of   additional   services   can   you offer to attract   new customers,   e.g. an   advertisement you   want   to   run,   etc.
▫                Product   development   –   explain   the   process   of   developing    new   product/service   and   how   this   will   add   value   to   the   company.   Ideas:   invest   in   RD,   or   acquire   a   company   that   has   the   knowledge/technology   you   are   after,   explain   how   and   why   customers   will value the   new   product
▫                Market development –   explain   which   country   you   plan   to   enter   and   provide   a   critical   discussion on   how   intend to   enter   it.
▫                Diversification    –      combine    the      discussion    from      product      development      and      market   development.   If you   are   entering   a   new   industry   with   a   new   product,   provide   some   additional      information      about    the       new      industry,      e.g.       how      attractive      is      it?      how   competitive   it   is, does   it   have   room for   investment etc.
•             Based    on    the    assessment    of    your   firm’s    current    conditions    (doing    good    or    bad    from   the   introduction section) how does this strategy and corresponding tactic help? For example, does   it turnaround the   bad   performance?   Or   builds   upon current success?
The   main   discussion   should   be   in   paragraphs   but   feel   free   to   use   tables/   graphs/   images   to   support   your arguments.
(7)      SAFe criteriaFrom the two   strategies   and   corresponding tactics   identified   in the   earlier   sections, you   now   need to   assess which ones are viable,   using the SAFe criteria. Which one(s) are you going to select? The one(s)   that will   best   pass the SAFe   criteria.You   need to   test   both   strategies   and   corresponding   tactic   via the   SAFe   criteria   and   the   strategy   that   pass ALL SAFe criteria is/are the   one(s) that   you   are   going   to   suggest   to   the   board   of   directors.   In   two   separate   paragraphs (one   for each strategy and corresponding tactic) you   need   to   explain/justify   why   this strategy and corresponding tactic   is or   is   not   suitable,   acceptable   and feasible.NOTE   1:   If   more   than   one   strategy   and   corresponding   tactic   passes   the   SAFe   criteria   when   assessed   individually,   you   should   consider    how    well   these    options    relate    to    each    other    and    make    a    clear   recommendation   about   how   your   board   of   directors   should   proceed:   should   they   chose   one   (which   one and why), should several options   be   pursued – if   so   why   does that   makes   sense   (e.g.   how   do   they   enhance   each   other),   should   one   come   before   the   other   (suggesting   sequential   implementation   and   why)   etc.
SAFe
(1)    Suitability   checklist:
            Does   it capitalise (uses effectively) on your firm’s strengths   and capabilities?   (as   identified in   your internal analysis)
            Fixes a weakness?   (as identified   in your internal analysis)
            Does   it exploit the opportunities you   identified   (as identified in your external   analysis)
            Does   it overcome the threats?   (as identified in your external analysis)Yes or   No and why?   Please   remember that, as with   all   SAFe   criteria,   the   answer   is typically   not   a   clear   yes   or   no,   but   every   option   will   address   some   points   mentioned   above   very   well,   others   not   so   well   and   some    not   at   all.   Therefore,    it   is    up   to   you,   on   the    bases   of   your   analysis   to    make   an   overall   assessment around whether you   believe the suitability criteria is sufficiently met   and   can   pass   (yes) or   the option   is   not suitable, overall   (no).
Check   Lecture 6 as well for   additional   criteria.
(2)    Acceptability   checklist:
There are three   key aspects of acceptability –   the   “3   R’s”   (Risk –   Return –   Reactions):
1.          Is   the   level   of   risk   acceptable?    Risk   can   be   assessed   using,   for   example:   Sensitivity   analysis,   Financial   risk,   Break-even analysis.NOTE:   I   do   NOT   expect   a   detailed   risk   analysis   -   I   expect   you   to   demonstrate   that   some   general   risk   considerations   have   been taken   into   account   and to   use your   critical thinking   and   make   an   informed   decision   (based   on   arguments/data   etc)   on whether   a strategy   is   acceptable   in terms   of the   involved   risks or   not. A   narrative discussion.
2.          Is the   likely   ROI acceptable?   ROI can   be assessed   using:   Financial   analysis,   Shareholder   value   analysis, Cost–benefit analysis,   Real options.
NOTE: Same as above -   I expect a   narrative analysis/judgement on whether this   strategy   will generate   profits and   how   soon.
3.          Will stakeholders’   reaction   be   positive?
You   need   to   go   back   to   your   stakeholders’   mapping   and   discussion   –   critically   explain   if   your   key   stakeholders will   have   positive   reactions or   not.
Yes or   No and why? Consider the   risk   level, the   ROI   and   add   them   to   the   stakeholders’   discussion.
(3)      Feasibility   checklist:
Three core questions   to   consider:
         Can the   strategy   be financed?   Do we   have the   money?       Financial   statements/balance   sheets   that   prove   the   profitability   of your   company.   In   plain   words,   do   you   have   the   money   or   any   money generating assets that you can   use to   pursue your   selected   strategy?
               Do   people   and   their   skills   exist   to   implement   the   strategy   OR   they   should   be   obtained?   Do   you   have   the   personnel you   need to   pursue   this   strategy   (e.g.   Scientists   if you   invest   in   RD   etc)   (yes/no   are they enough?)   OR will you   have to   recruit?   (Can you do   it?   Money? Time?)
            Do the capabilities exist to   implement the strategy   OR can   they   be   obtained?
         Value chain – Are your   processes effective and efficient?   Can   you   support this   strategy?Yes   or   No   and   why?   Again,   remember   that   the   answer   is   typically   not   a   clear   yes   or   no,   but   every   option   will   address   some   points   mentioned   above   very   well,   others   not   as   well   and   some   not   at   all.   Therefore,   it   is   up to you   considering   all your   analysis,   to   make   an   overall   assessment   as to   whether   you   believe   the   feasibility   criteria   is   sufficiently   met   and   can   pass   (yes)   or   the   option   is   not   feasible,   overall   (no).
